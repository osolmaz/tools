# Pi Extensions

- Read the installed Pi documentation and relevant examples completely before changing an extension.
- Keep each extension independent under `packages/pi-<name>/` with a Pi manifest, entry point,
  tests, and README; also register development entry points in the root Pi manifest.
- Use strict TypeScript. Do not use explicit `any`, unsafe casts, or unchecked external input.
- Keep transcript selection and folding policy separate from Pi TUI patching and other runtime
  integration.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change.
- Avoid new runtime dependencies when the standard library or Pi APIs suffice.
- Follow `VENDORING.md` when adopting third-party extensions. Vendor small, low-traction extensions
  before installing them.
- Before finishing, run `npm run check`, `npm run mutate`, `npm run slophammer`, and
  `git diff --check`.
