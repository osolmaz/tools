# @onurpi/turn-fold

Turn-level transcript folding for the Pi coding agent.

`@onurpi/turn-fold` keeps the final assistant response visible while replacing the intermediate assistant
messages and tool rows from a completed turn with one compact summary. The underlying session
messages are not changed and remain in model context.

## Modes

| Mode         | Behavior                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `live`       | Shows normal activity while Pi works, then folds the completed turn.     |
| `final-only` | Shows one live activity row, followed by the summary and final response. |
| `expanded`   | Shows the complete transcript.                                           |

`live` is the default.

A folded row looks like:

```text
▶ Worked for 14s · 8 tools · 2 msgs · Ctrl+Shift+O
```

## Use during development

From `agents/onurpi`:

```bash
npm install
pi -e ./packages/turn-fold/index.ts
```

The package is private and is not published yet.

## Controls

```text
/turn-fold                         open the mode picker
/turn-fold live                    show activity, then fold
/turn-fold final-only              hide intermediate activity while running
/turn-fold expanded                show complete turns
/turn-fold toggle                  toggle the compact mode and expanded mode
/turn-fold status                  show the current mode
```

`Ctrl+Shift+O` toggles between the current compact mode and expanded mode. `Ctrl+O` remains Pi's
separate tool-output detail toggle.

Mode changes are stored as custom session entries, so each session restores its latest choice.
Historical turns are reconstructed from the active session branch when Pi starts or reloads.

## Current implementation boundary

Pi does not expose a public whole-turn transcript renderer. This extension uses Pi's exported
assistant and tool component classes but patches their rendering methods. It targets Pi 0.80.10 or
newer and must be retested when Pi changes its interactive transcript components.

Pi's public TUI API is keyboard-focused and does not provide inline mouse-click handlers for
transcript rows. The mode picker and shortcut provide expansion without pretending the summary row
is clickable.

```bash
npm run check
