name: acpx
description: Use when calling, reviewing with, or delegating work to another coding agent through the ACPX CLI, including Claude Fable through Cursor, one-shot and persistent sessions, model selection, permissions, timeouts, output collection, and recovery after interrupted calls.

# ACPX

Use `acpx` for agent-to-agent work instead of scraping an interactive terminal.

## Required defaults

- Run from the target repository or pass `--cwd <repo>` so the agent sees the
  intended checkout and repository instructions.
- Pass `--timeout 1800` for every prompt, exec, compare, or flow run unless the
  user explicitly asks to hurry or specifies another timeout.
- Do not shorten the ACPX timeout merely to fit the caller's polling window.
  Start the command as a long-running process and keep polling it.
- Avoid low `--max-turns` values for audits and implementation work. Omit the
  option unless a turn cap is intentional.
- Treat another agent's answer as advisory. Verify findings against repository
  state and local test results before reporting or editing.

## Session mode

Use a one-shot temporary session only when no follow-up or recovery is likely:

```bash
acpx --cwd "$REPO" --timeout 1800 \
  --approve-reads --non-interactive-permissions deny \
  cursor exec "$PROMPT"
```

Use a named persistent session for deep reviews, implementation, long reports,
or any task likely to need clarification or continuation:

```bash
acpx --cwd "$REPO" --timeout 1800 cursor sessions ensure --name fable-review
acpx --cwd "$REPO" --timeout 1800 \
  --approve-reads --non-interactive-permissions deny \
  cursor -s fable-review "$PROMPT"
```

Persistent sessions make interrupted output recoverable. Inspect them with:

```bash
acpx --cwd "$REPO" cursor status -s fable-review
acpx --cwd "$REPO" cursor sessions show fable-review
acpx --cwd "$REPO" cursor sessions history fable-review --limit 20
```

## Claude Fable through Cursor

Use the Cursor adapter and request Fable explicitly:

```bash
acpx --cwd "$REPO" --timeout 1800 \
  --model claude-fable-5 \
  --approve-reads --non-interactive-permissions deny \
  cursor exec "$PROMPT"
```

Model identifiers are adapter-defined. Read the model advertised by ACPX. If
the adapter reports a more exact bracketed identifier, use that exact identifier
when the bare name is ambiguous. Do not silently substitute a different model.

## Permissions

- For review, research, and planning, use `--approve-reads` with
  `--non-interactive-permissions deny`. Tell the agent not to edit.
- Use `--approve-all` only when the user has authorized the delegated agent to
  edit and execute the required work.
- Use `--policy <file-or-json>` when permissions need narrower tool-specific
  control.
- ACPX permission flags are mutually exclusive.

## Prompts and output

- State the target, scope, constraints, expected evidence, and output format.
- Ask for exact file and line references for review findings.
- Ask the agent to distinguish new findings from issues already covered by a
  plan, intentional behavior, and false positives.
- Use `--format text` while monitoring work, `--format quiet` when only the final
  answer is needed, and `--format json --json-strict` for machine consumption.
- For a long audit, ask for a concise final report but do not reduce the timeout.
- Keep polling until ACPX exits. Do not report completion while its process is
  still running.

## Recovery

- Prefer a persistent named session when losing the final answer would require
  repeating expensive repository analysis.
- If a call is interrupted, inspect session status and history before starting a
  replacement audit.
- Continue the same named session with a short prompt asking it to emit the
  pending final report.
- Cancel obsolete work with `acpx <agent> cancel -s <name>` or interrupt the
  active process so ACPX can send cooperative `session/cancel`.
- If the command itself times out, increase the timeout. Do not respond by
  constraining the agent to an artificially small turn budget.

Use `acpx --help` and `acpx <agent> --help` when the installed CLI differs from
these examples. The installed ACPX package also ships its full reference skill
under `skills/acpx/SKILL.md`.
