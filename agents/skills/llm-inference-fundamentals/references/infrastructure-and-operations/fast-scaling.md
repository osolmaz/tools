# Fast scaling

Running LLM inference in production is a very different game from training models. Unlike training, which is batch-based and predictable, inference is driven by real-time user demand. That demand is often bursty, hard to predict, and unforgiving of latency or downtime.

This means the system needs to scale up quickly during traffic spikes and scale down to zero when idle to save costs. This kind of elasticity is fundamental to efficiency.

However, many organizations treat inference like training: they pre-allocate fixed GPU capacity through long-term commitments. This often leads to:

- **Over-provisioning**: Wasted GPU capacity, high idle costs.
- **Under-provisioning**: Dropped requests, latency spikes, and poor user experience.
- **Inflexible budgets**: Rigid spending that doesn't adapt to real usage patterns.

## Why serverless isn’t a silver bullet

The scaling problem seems familiar, one that serverless computing solved years ago. Platforms like AWS Lambda made it easy to scale to demand, but serverless doesn’t map well to AI workloads. Here’s why:

- **No GPU support**: Most serverless platforms don’t support GPUs. This isn't merely a technical oversight; it's rooted in architectural and practical considerations.
- **GPUs can’t be sliced easily**: GPUs are powerful and highly parallel, but they are not as flexible as CPUs for handling many inference tasks across different models at the same time.
- **High cost of idle GPUs**: They're the high-performance sports cars of the computing world, exceptional for specific tasks but costly to maintain, especially if not utilized continuously.

## The cold start problem

Inference workloads need infrastructure that can scale quickly, manage costs, and stay performant. A fundamental challenge in scaling is the cold start. 

In the context of deploying LLMs in containers, a cold start occurs when a Kubernetes node has never previously run a given deployment. As a result, the container image is not cached locally, and all image layers must be pulled and initialized from scratch.

This issue presents itself in three different stages:

1. **Cloud provisioning**: This step involves the time it takes for the cloud provider to allocate a new instance and attach it to the Kubernetes cluster. Depending on the instance type and availability, this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes, or even hours for high-demand GPUs like NVIDIA A100 and H100.
2. **Container image pulling**: LLM images are significantly larger and more complex than typical Python job images, due to numerous dependencies and custom libraries. Despite claims of multi-gigabit bandwidth by cloud providers, actual image download speeds are often much slower. As a result, pulling images can take three to five minutes.
3. **Model loading**. The time required to load the model depends heavily on its size. LLMs introduce significant delays due to their billions of parameters. Key bottlenecks include:

   - **Slow downloads from model hubs**: Platforms like Hugging Face are not optimized for high-throughput, multi-part downloads, making the retrieval of large model files time-consuming.
   - **Sequential data flow**: Model files are transferred through multiple hops: **remote storage → local disk → memory → GPU**. There is little or no parallelization between these steps. Each step adds latency, particularly for large files that are difficult to cache or stream.
   - **Lack of on-demand streaming**: Model files must be fully downloaded and written to disk before inference can begin. This introduces additional I/O operations and delays startup.

Each phase of the cold start issue demands specific strategies to minimize delays. For more information, see how BentoML solves the cold start problem: [25x Faster Cold Starts for LLMs on Kubernetes](https://www.bentoml.com/blog/25x-faster-cold-starts-for-llms-on-kubernetes).

## Scaling metrics

Scaling infrastructure for LLM inference requires more than simply reacting to system load. Choosing the right metrics is critical for achieving responsive, efficient, and cost-effective scaling.

- **CPU utilization**. It’s simple and comes with clear thresholds, but it doesn’t reflect real load for Python-based workloads. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits CPU parallelism, especially on multi-core machines, making this metric misleading for scaling decisions.
- **GPU utilization**. A more relevant metric in theory, but inaccurate in practice. Tools like `nvml` report GPUs as “utilized” if any kernel runs during a sample window—even briefly. This doesn’t account for batching or actual throughput, leading to premature scale-up or false confidence in capacity.
- **QPS (queries per second)**. Widely used in traditional web services, but less useful for LLM inference. Generative requests vary greatly in size and compute cost, depending on input length and tokens generated. As a result, QPS lacks consistency and is hard to tune for auto-scaling.
- **Concurrency**. This metric, which represents the number of active requests either queued or being processed, is an ideal measure for reflecting system load. Concurrency is easy to configure based on batch size and provides a direct correlation with actual system demands, allowing for precise scaling. However, for concurrency to work, you need support from a service framework to [automatically instrument concurrency as a metric and serve it as a scaling signal](https://www.bentoml.com/blog/scaling-ai-model-deployment) for the deployment platform.
