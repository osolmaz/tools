# What is distributed inference?

Distributed inference improves how AI systems handle production workloads by spreading inference computation across multiple connected machines. Rather than pushing all requests through a single server, the system coordinates many workers so no single device becomes a bottleneck.

This approach allows inference systems to scale smoothly as traffic grows, stay resilient when individual components fail, and expose clear visibility into latency, throughput, and resource usage.

## Understanding distributed inference

Depending on the perspective, distributed inference can describe different layers of the system.

### Global distributed inference architecture

On the macro level, distributed inference refers to high-level deployment and topology decisions:

- Running a model, or multiple replicas of it, across multiple geographic regions
- Serving traffic on heterogeneous GPU clusters with different hardware profiles
- Orchestrating inference across [multiple cloud (or NeoCloud) providers](./multi-cloud-and-cross-region-inference), and [on-prem data centers](../getting-started/on-prem-llms)

At this level, teams distribute inference geographically to reduce latency, meet data residency requirements, improve fault tolerance, or take advantage of cheaper or more available GPU capacity in specific regions.

Ideally, a distributed inference system treats all of these compute resources as one logical serving layer. Incoming traffic is routed to the best available location based on factors like latency, current load, cost, or GPU availability. This also means it is able to implement multi-region routing, seamless failover, and elastic scaling without disrupting user experience.

Macro-level distributed inference is primarily about where inference runs: location, GPU sourcing, and large-scale failure domains.

### Inference parallelism and runtime optimizations

On the micro level, distributed inference refers to the low-level optimization techniques that split the work of a single inference request, or a batch of requests, across workers, nodes, or GPUs.

These techniques focus on parallelizing the internal mechanics of inference itself and have driven most of the recent efficiency gains in large-scale LLM serving.

Common examples include:

- [Prefill–decode disaggregation](../inference-optimization/prefill-decode-disaggregation). Separating prefill and decode work so each stage can run on specialized hardware.
- [KV cache offloading](../inference-optimization/kv-cache-offloading). Moving KV cache data to CPU memory or remote storage to reduce GPU memory pressure and compute costs.
- [Inference routing](../inference-optimization/inference-routing). Routing a request to the worker that holds useful cache or has enough capacity, reducing recomputation and improving throughput.
- [Parallelism](../inference-optimization/data-tensor-pipeline-expert-hybrid-parallelism). Splitting a large model across multiple GPUs when it cannot fit on a single device. This can take several forms, such as single-node multi-GPU and multi-node multi-GPU.

Micro-level distributed inference is mainly about how inference runs efficiently, independent of where the infrastructure is deployed.

## Why should you run distributed inference?

As models grow larger and traffic becomes less predictable, distributing inference becomes a practical necessity rather than an optimization.

Below are the key reasons teams adopt distributed inference in production systems.

### Scale beyond a single GPU or machine

A single GPU has hard limits on throughput, memory, and concurrency. Distributed inference allows systems to scale horizontally by adding more workers, rather than forcing all traffic through one device.

This is especially important for:

- Concurrent chat or agent workloads
- High-throughput batch inference pipelines
- Models with long context windows and large KV caches

Instead of hitting fixed ceilings, capacity grows with your infrastructure.

### Serve larger models that don’t fit on one GPU

Many modern LLMs exceed the memory capacity of a single GPU, even with quantization, particularly once KV cache growth is taken into account. As model parameter counts increase, so do memory and compute requirements for inference.

Distributed inference makes it possible to serve these models by splitting them across multiple GPUs or even multiple nodes. This enables teams to run larger models, support longer contexts, and avoid out-of-memory failures that would otherwise make production deployment impossible.

### Increase reliability and fault tolerance

Production inference systems must tolerate failures. GPUs crash, nodes go offline, and entire regions can become unavailable. With distributed inference:

- Traffic can be rerouted automatically when a worker fails
- Regional outages do not bring down the entire service
- Capacity can be rebalanced dynamically during incidents

This transforms inference from a fragile single point of failure into a resilient, production-grade service.

### Reduce costs through smarter resource usage

Distributed inference makes it possible to optimize cost without sacrificing performance. Instead of over-provisioning a single powerful machine, teams can allocate resources more precisely.

Common cost-saving strategies include:

- Mixing different GPU types for different inference workloads
- Scaling capacity down during off-peak hours
- Routing traffic to lower-cost regions or providers
- Offloading memory-heavy components such as KV cache

The result is higher GPU utilization and a lower cost per request.

---

Generally speaking, you need distributed inference when:

- Traffic is unpredictable or spiky
- Models are large or memory-intensive
- Uptime and latency matter
- GPU cost and utilization need active optimization

At that point, scaling up a single server is no longer enough. Distributed inference becomes the foundation of your serving architecture.

## Challenges of distributed inference

Before moving beyond single-node deployments, it’s important to understand the following trade-offs.

### Network communication overhead

Distributed inference relies on frequent communication between workers, GPUs, and nodes. Model sharding, prefill–decode disaggregation, KV cache movement, and cross-node coordination all introduce network overhead.

This can lead to:

- Increased end-to-end latency due to inter-GPU or inter-node communication
- Sensitivity to network bandwidth and jitter
- Performance degradation if interconnects are slow or unreliable

As inference becomes more distributed, networking often becomes a bottleneck rather than raw compute.

### Build and operational complexity

Distributed systems are inherently more complex to build and operate than single-node setups. Teams must manage multiple moving parts, including orchestration, autoscaling, routing, health checks, and observability.

Common challenges include:

- Coordinating deployments across clusters or regions
- Managing configuration drift between environments
- Ensuring consistent behavior during scaling events

Without strong tooling and specialized expertise, operational complexity can quickly outweigh performance gains.

### Unified observability and cost visibility

As inference spreads across multiple workers, GPUs, clusters, and regions, maintaining a unified view of system behavior becomes significantly harder.

Teams often struggle with:

- Correlating latency, throughput, and errors across distributed components
- Understanding GPU utilization and memory pressure at a global level
- Attributing cost to specific models, workloads, or tenants
- Detecting inefficiencies such as idle GPUs or imbalanced traffic

Without [centralized observability](./comprehensive-observability) and cost visibility, distributed inference systems can become opaque. This makes it difficult to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.

### State management and consistency

Many inference workloads are stateful. Chat sessions, agent workflows, streaming responses, and KV cache reuse all rely on preserving state across requests.

In distributed environments, this raises questions such as:

- Where session state or KV cache should live
- How state is shared, replicated, or migrated between workers
- What happens when a worker holding critical state fails

Poor state management can lead to recomputation, cache misses, or degraded latency.

## Designing and running a distributed inference system

Building a distributed inference system is not just about adding more GPUs. It requires you to coordinate compute, schedule work intelligently, manage state, and route traffic efficiently across a fleet of heterogeneous resources.

At a high level, a production-grade distributed inference system needs the following components.

### Intelligent scheduling and request routing

At the heart of distributed inference is a scheduler that decides where each request should run. This decision depends on multiple factors:

- GPU availability and memory pressure
- Current load and queue depth
- Request characteristics such as prompt length, batch size, and streaming behavior
- Cached state such as KV cache size and locality
- Latency or cost constraints

A naive round-robin scheduler quickly breaks down at scale. Modern inference systems rely on dynamic, state-aware scheduling to maintain throughput and predictable latency.

### Distributed inference runtimes

Most teams do not build distributed inference from scratch. Instead, they rely on specialized runtimes that implement core [inference techniques](../inference-optimization/) such as parallelism and prefix-aware routing.

In practice, teams often run inference runtimes such as vLLM, SGLang, and llm-d on Kubernetes. To some extent, they do help handle how inference runs at the micro level, but they do not fully solve macro-level concerns for LLM workloads such as multi-region routing, autoscaling, or operational visibility.

### Orchestration, scaling, and observability

To run distributed inference in production, teams must also integrate:

- Autoscaling policies across GPU pools
- Health checks and failure recovery
- Unified observability for [latency (e.g., TTFT and ITL)](../llm-inference-basics/llm-inference-metrics), throughput, GPU utilization, and errors
- Cost attribution across models, regions, and workloads

This orchestration layer is often where most engineering effort goes, especially when operating across multiple clusters or clouds.

## Using a platform instead of building everything yourself

For many teams, building and maintaining all of these layers internally becomes a long-term operational burden. This is where a production inference platform can significantly reduce complexity.

Our Inference Platform provides a production-ready foundation for distributed inference, integrating:

- Intelligent request routing and scheduling
- Advanced inference optimization techniques like [prefill-decode disaggregation](../inference-optimization/prefill-decode-disaggregation)
- Multi-GPU, cross-region, and multi-cloud deployment
- Autoscaling, fault tolerance, and unified observability

Rather than stitching together everything yourself, a platform-based approach allows teams to focus on models and applications, while the distributed inference system is managed as a cohesive layer.
