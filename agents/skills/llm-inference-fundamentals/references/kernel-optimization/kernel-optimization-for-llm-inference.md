# Kernel optimization for LLM Inference

When people talk about speeding up LLM inference, they usually jump to batching, caching, or routing. That makes sense. Those are visible, system-level levers.

Underneath all of that, there’s a quieter layer doing the actual work: GPU kernels.

## What is kernel optimization?

When an LLM generates a token, the GPU executes a sequence of highly parallel operations, such as matrix multiplications, attention, normalization, and activation functions. These operations are implemented using GPU kernels: functions that run across a large number of GPU threads simultaneously.

Some operations map to a single kernel, while others are composed of multiple kernels. In many cases, multiple operations can also be fused into a single kernel, which is one of the most impactful optimizations available.

Think of kernels as the inner loops of LLM inference. They handle the core numerical work behind each token generation step and are where most of the compute time is actually spent.

Kernel optimization is the practice of making these functions run faster and more efficiently by: 

- Reducing latency per operation
- Increasing hardware utilization (compute units, memory bandwidth, etc.)
- Minimizing memory movement and data transfers

At a high level, there are two common approaches to kernel optimization depending on how much control you want over the GPU.

- **Hand-written kernels**. This is the traditional path. You write and tune GPU kernels directly, often using CUDA or higher-level kernel DSLs like Triton. Examples include:
    - Custom CUDA kernels
    - Optimized attention implementations like FlashAttention
    
    This gives you fine-grained control. You can design and tune memory access, thread layout, and computation schedule from scratch. However, it’s also hard as it requires deep knowledge of GPU architecture.
    
    :::note
    For Triton, you're still writing kernels, but the tile-based programming model hides many of the low-level details: no manual warp management, no explicit shared memory scheduling for common patterns. This makes Triton easier than writing raw CUDA kernels. It also provides more control than fully compiler-driven methods.
    :::
    
- **Compiler-driven optimization**. You rely on compiler systems such as TVM or XLA to generate optimized kernels from a higher-level description of computation. These systems can:
    - Fuse multiple operations into one kernel
    - Reorder computation for better efficiency
    - Generate optimized kernels automatically
    
    In this model, you describe what to compute, and the compiler determines how to execute it efficiently for the target hardware backend. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry. However, it offers less direct control over low-level execution and may lag behind hand-written kernels when supporting new model architectures or specialized computation patterns.

## What kernel optimization is not

It’s easy to mix it up with other optimization techniques covered in the [Inference Optimization](../inference-optimization/) chapter. Kernel optimization is not:

- Continuous or dynamic batching
- Prefix caching
- KV cache routing or offloading
- Load balancing across GPUs
- Multi-region or multi-cloud deployment

Those operate at the system and runtime layer above the kernels. Kernel optimization goes one level deeper, into the GPU code that actually does the computation.

A simple way to separate them:

- Kernel optimization: how fast a single operation runs on a GPU
- System optimization: how efficiently requests flow through the overall serving infrastructure

Both matter. They just solve fundamentally different problems.

## Why most teams never touch this layer

Most AI engineers never write a GPU kernel, and for good reason. Inference frameworks like vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM abstract away all low-level execution.

This means you can simply:

- Load a model
- Call an API
- Focus on product features

This abstraction is intentional. One of the goals of modern inference frameworks is to make GPU complexity invisible. Additionally, if a framework already delivers acceptable performance, there is no obvious reason to go deeper.

## Why kernel optimization still matters

Even if you never write a kernel yourself, the kernel layer sets the ceiling for everything above it. 

### New architectures need new kernels

When a new model architecture comes out, it often brings new patterns:

- New attention mechanisms
- New tensor shapes
- New compute orders

Supporting it is not just writing it in PyTorch. You often need new kernels or new ways to fuse operations.

Frameworks like vLLM or SGLang rely on prebuilt, pre-optimized kernel libraries. They don’t automatically support every new idea on day one. Until someone writes and integrates efficient kernels for the new computation pattern, the framework either falls back to slower generic implementations or doesn't support the architecture at all.

That’s why there’s often a gap between:

- A model being released
- That model running efficiently in production

FlashAttention itself is a good example. It wasn't a feature that any inference framework invented. It was a standalone kernel optimization that frameworks adopted after it proved its value.

### The performance ceiling is real

High-level frameworks are, in a way, orchestration layers built on top of collections of kernels. vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM all ultimately dispatch kernels for the actual computation. This means inference speed cannot exceed what the underlying kernels allow. 

System-level optimizations can help, but they can’t fully compensate for inefficient kernels. If the bottleneck is in the kernel itself, no runtime-level change will close the gap.

### Hardware portability

If you write custom CUDA kernels, they only run on NVIDIA GPUs. That creates lock-in:

- Moving to AMD GPUs or other accelerators becomes hard
- You may need to rewrite kernels from scratch

This is why portability layers and compiler-based solutions are becoming more important. They try to solve a tough tradeoff:

- **Peak performance on a specific backend**
- **Broader portability across hardware backends**

Most teams want both. Few solutions fully deliver it today. A kernel carefully tuned for one GPU architecture often does not perform well on another without significant rework.

## FAQs

### What is a GPU kernel?

A GPU kernel is a small program that runs in parallel across a large number of GPU threads.

In LLM inference, kernels handle the actual math, such as:

- Matrix multiplications
- Attention computations
- Normalization and activation functions

You can think of a kernel as a unit of work executed on the GPU. When your model generates a token, it triggers many kernels under the hood.

### What is kernel fusion?

Kernel fusion means combining multiple operations into a single GPU kernel. The key benefit is reducing memory movement and kernel launch overhead.

Consider making a sandwich. Without fusion, every operation in a chain is a separate job:

1. **Job 1**: Go to the fridge, get the bread, bring it to the counter, toast it, then put it back
2. **Job 2**: Go to the fridge, get that toasted bread, bring it back to the counter, add ham, then put it back
3. **Job 3**: Go to the fridge again, get the ham sandwich, bring it back to the counter, add cheese, then put it back

In GPU terms, the fridge represents global memory (HBM) and the counter represents fast on-chip memory (registers, shared memory, caches). The key issue is that moving data between HBM and on-chip memory is much more expensive than the computation itself.

Without fusion:

- Each operation often writes intermediate results back to global memory
- The next operation reads them again
- This means repeated memory round-trips and high bandwidth pressure

With fusion:

- Multiple operations are combined into a single kernel
- Intermediate results can often stay in fast on-chip memory
- You avoid unnecessary global memory reads/writes
