# Choosing the right inference framework

Once you’ve selected a model, the next step is choosing how to run it. Your choice of inference framework directly affects latency, throughput, hardware efficiency, and feature support. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. The right choice depends on your deployment scenario, workload, model, and infrastructure.

## What are inference frameworks?

An inference framework is the software layer that loads a model, runs it on the right hardware, and serves outputs to applications. For LLMs, this usually means more than calling the `forward()` function of the model. A framework also manages token generation, [KV cache](../inference-optimization/kv-cache-offloading), batching, streaming responses, memory limits, and request handling.

You may also see these tools called inference runtimes, inference engines, inference backends, or model servers. The exact meaning varies by project, but the core job is the same: make model execution efficient and usable outside a training notebook.

## Why do I need an inference framework?

You can run inference directly with a raw model in PyTorch or Hugging Face Transformers. That is often enough for experiments, local testing, or one request at a time. It is usually not enough for production inference.

Training frameworks are built around learning weights. They support backpropagation, optimizer steps, gradient accumulation, and large training batches. Inference has different goals: low latency, high throughput, stable memory use, streaming output, and predictable behavior under concurrent traffic.

Inference frameworks handle the serving-specific work that raw model execution does not solve well, such as:

- **Batching and scheduling**: Combine active requests so GPUs stay busy.
- **KV cache management**: Store attention state efficiently for long prompts and multi-turn chats.
- **Streaming**: Return tokens as they are generated instead of waiting for the full response.
- **Memory control**: Fit larger models and more concurrent requests into limited GPU memory.
- **Production APIs**: Expose [OpenAI-compatible](../model-interaction/openai-compatible-api) or framework-specific endpoints.
- **Multi-GPU support**: Split large models across devices when one GPU is not enough.

These frameworks hide much of the model execution complexity behind serving options you can tune. Here is an example of using vLLM to serve DeepSeek-V4-Flash. You can tune different configurations directly without touching the model itself. vLLM automatically handles it for you.

```bash
vllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --kv-cache-dtype fp8 \
  --block-size 256 \
  --enable-expert-parallel \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --attention_config.use_fp4_indexer_cache=True \
  --moe-backend deep_gemm_mega_moe \
  --tokenizer-mode deepseek_v4 \
  --tool-call-parser deepseek_v4 \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --reasoning-parser deepseek_v4
```

By abstracting away low-level infrastructure work, inference frameworks let you focus on building applications instead of reimplementing inference logic for each model architecture.

The benefit is not just convenience. A good inference framework can improve the latency, throughput, and cost profile of the same model on the same hardware. For example, [in a 2023 benchmark](https://vllm.ai/blog/2023-06-20-vllm), the vLLM team reported up to 24× higher throughput than Hugging Face Transformers without requiring any changes to the underlying model architecture.

## Inference frameworks and tools

Popular inference frameworks for building high-throughput, low-latency LLM applications include:

- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). A high-performance inference engine optimized for serving LLMs. It is known for its efficient use of GPU resources and fast decoding capabilities.
- [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang). A fast serving framework for LLMs and vision language models. It makes your interaction with models faster and more controllable by co-designing the backend runtime and frontend language.
- [Max](https://github.com/modular/modular). A high-performance AI serving framework from Modular. It provides an integrated suite of tools for AI compute workloads across CPUs and GPUs and supports customization at both the model and [kernel level](../kernel-optimization/kernel-optimization-tools).
- [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy). An inference backend focusing on delivering high decoding speed and efficient handling of concurrent requests. It supports various quantization techniques, making it suitable for deploying large models with reduced memory requirements.
- [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM). An inference backend that leverages NVIDIA's TensorRT, a high-performance deep learning inference library. It is optimized for running large models on NVIDIA GPUs, providing fast inference and support for advanced optimizations like quantization.
- [Hugging Face TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference). A toolkit for deploying and serving LLMs. It is used in production at Hugging Face to power Hugging Chat, the Inference API and Inference Endpoint. Note that Hugging Face TGI is now in **maintenance mode**. This means it is still supported and usable, but there will no longer be major feature development or new performance optimizations. If you’re running TGI in production, it’s worth planning an upgrade path as your performance or scaling needs grow.

If you're working with limited hardware or targeting desktop/edge devices, these tools are optimized for low-resource environments:

- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). A lightweight inference runtime for LLMs, implemented in plain C/C++ with no external dependencies. Its primary goal is to make LLM inference fast, portable, and easy to run across a wide range of hardware. Despite the name, llama.cpp supports far more than just Llama models. It supports many popular architectures like Qwen, DeepSeek, and Mistral. The tool is ideal for low-latency inference and performs well on consumer-grade GPUs.
- [MLC-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm). An ML compiler and high-performance deployment engine for LLMs. It is built on top of Apache TVM and requires compilation and weight conversion before serving models. MLC-LLM can be used for a wide range of hardware platforms, supporting AMD, NVIDIA, Apple, and Intel GPUs across Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and web browsers.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). A user-friendly local inference tool built on top of llama.cpp. It’s designed for simplicity and ease of use, ideal for running models on your laptop with minimal setup. However, Ollama is mainly used for single-request use cases. Unlike runtimes like vLLM or SGLang, it doesn’t support concurrent requests. This difference matters since many inference optimizations, such as paged attention, prefix caching, and dynamic batching, are only effective when handling multiple requests in parallel.

Several of these frameworks have also evolved beyond text generation to serve diffusion models. 
- [SGLang Diffusion](https://docs.sglang.io/docs/sglang-diffusion) supports image and video models like FLUX, Wan, and Qwen-Image. 
- [vLLM-Omni](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-omni/en/latest/) extends vLLM to Diffusion Transformers (DiT) and other parallel, non-autoregressive generation models across text, image, video, and audio.
- [MAX](https://www.modular.com/solutions/image-generation?utm_source=bentoml_llm) serves diffusion models like FLUX up to 4x faster than native PyTorch.

## Library mode vs. server mode

Many model inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, support two deployment patterns. You can embed the framework as a library inside your application for better control over execution, or run it as a standalone server that external clients call through an HTTP API.

### Embed the framework as a library

Library mode loads the inference engine in the same process as your application. This works well for offline batch jobs, evaluation pipelines, and custom services that need direct access to engine outputs without an extra network hop.

For example, the [vLLM offline inference API](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/offline_inference.html) exposes an `LLM` class:

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
llm = LLM(model=model)

outputs = llm.generate(
    ["Explain continuous batching in two sentences."],
    SamplingParams(temperature=0.2, max_tokens=64),
)
```

[SGLang's offline engine](https://docs.sglang.io/docs/basic_usage/offline_engine_api) provides a similar interface:

```python
import sglang as sgl

model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
llm = sgl.Engine(model_path=model)

outputs = llm.generate(
    ["Explain continuous batching in two sentences."],
    {"temperature": 0.2, "max_new_tokens": 64},
)
```

The application now owns the engine lifecycle. A crash, dependency conflict, or GPU out-of-memory error can affect the entire process, so this pattern requires careful resource and concurrency management.

### Run the framework as a standalone server

Server mode runs the inference engine in a separate process and exposes a REST or streaming API. This is usually a better boundary when multiple applications share a model, clients use different programming languages, or the serving layer needs to scale and deploy independently.

Start an OpenAI-compatible vLLM server:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8000
```

Or start an SGLang server:

```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 30000
```

Because both servers expose an [OpenAI-compatible API](../model-interaction/openai-compatible-api), the application code can use the same client interface like this:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="EMPTY",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain continuous batching in two sentences."}
    ],
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=64,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

The server boundary adds network and serialization overhead, but it isolates the inference runtime from application code. This makes routing, authentication, observability, and independent scaling easier to add. In either mode, the framework still handles model execution, batching, and KV cache management. The specific choice depends on your use case and how your application integrates with that engine.

## Why do you need multiple inference runtimes?

In real-world deployments, no single runtime is perfect for every scenario. Here’s why AI teams often end up using more than one:

### Different use cases have different needs

Models, hardware, and workloads vary. The best performance often comes from matching each use case with a runtime tailored to that environment.

- **High-throughput, batching**: vLLM, SGLang, MAX, LMDeploy, TensorRT-LLM (tuning needed for better performance)
- **Edge/mobile deployment**: MLC-LLM, llama.cpp
- **Local experimentation or single-user scenario**: Ollama and llama.cpp
- **Diffusion model serving (image/video, multimodal)**: SGLang Diffusion, vLLM-Omni, MAX

### Toolchains and frameworks evolve fast

Inference runtimes are constantly updated. The best tool today may be missing features next month. Additionally, some models are only optimized (or supported) in specific runtimes at launch.

To stay flexible, your infrastructure should be runtime-agnostic. This lets you combine the best of each tool without getting locked into a single stack.

## Scaling from local LLMs to distributed inference

Many teams follow the same general path as they scale LLM inference.

They often begin with tools like Ollama to run models locally on a laptop or small workstation. This works well for quick demos and early prototyping. It’s simple and private, but limited to single-user workloads with no real concurrency or batching.

From there, teams move to high-performance server runtimes like vLLM. These frameworks provide continuous batching, KV cache optimizations, and improved GPU utilization on data center GPUs. However, most of these runtimes lack built-in multi-region routing, automatic failover, and true horizontal scaling. GPU provisioning, performance tuning, and fault tolerance also remain complex and time-consuming to implement.

When teams need to run and scale inference across multiple GPU clusters, regions, or clouds, they typically adopt [distributed inference](../infrastructure-and-operations/distributed-inference) platforms to handle autoscaling, routing, observability, and compliance requirements at production scale. These platforms provide advanced features out of the box, which means your engineering team can focus on product innovation instead of building and maintaining infrastructure.

## FAQs

### Are all inference frameworks compatible with every LLM?

Not always. Some frameworks support specific architectures first. Others take time to add advanced features like multi-GPU support, speculative decoding, and custom attention backends. Always check model-specific compatibility before selecting a runtime.

### Which inference frameworks support distributed inference for LLMs?

Some models are too large to fit on a single GPU, so you need distributed inference. Frameworks like vLLM and SGLang offer advanced optimizations like prefill-decode disaggregation or KV-aware routing across multiple workers. They let you run larger models, handle longer context windows, and serve more concurrent traffic without hitting memory limits.

### What’s the best way to start experimenting with inference frameworks?

A good path is to begin small and level up as you go. Many people start with Ollama because it runs on a laptop with almost no setup. It’s perfect for quick tests, [prompt tinkering](../model-interaction/prompt-engineering), or getting a feel for how different models behave. Once you understand the basics and want to evaluate real performance for production, move to vLLM, SGLang, or MAX. These frameworks are built for production-level workloads, so you can measure latency, throughput, batching behavior, and GPU efficiency in a realistic environment.
