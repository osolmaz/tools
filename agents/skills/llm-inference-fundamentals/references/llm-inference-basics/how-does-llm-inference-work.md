# How does an LLM work?

A typical autoregressive LLM reads text as tokens, processes them through a
stack of Transformer layers built around the attention mechanism, and generates
output one token at a time. This page walks through that pipeline: how text
becomes tokens, what the model architecture looks like inside, and how inference
proceeds through prefill and decode phases.

## What are tokens and tokenization?

A token is the smallest unit of language that LLMs use to process text. It can
be a word, subword, or even a character, depending on the tokenizer. Each LLM
has its own tokenizer, with different tokenization algorithms.

Before text can be processed by the model, it must first go through
tokenization. Tokenization is the process of splitting input text, such as a
sentence or paragraph, into tokens.

Each LLM has a vocabulary: a fixed set of tokens the model can represent. Each
token in the vocabulary maps to a token ID. During tokenization, tokens are
converted into token IDs before being passed into the model during inference.

Here is a tokenization example for the sentence
`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` using
[GPT-5's tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer):

```bash
Tokens: "The", " quick", " brown", " fox", " jumps", " over", " the", " lazy", " dog", "."

Token IDs: [976, 4853, 19705, 68347, 65613, 1072, 290, 29082, 6446, 13]
```

For output, LLMs generate new tokens autoregressively. Starting with an initial
sequence of tokens, the model predicts the next token based on everything it has
seen so far. This repeats until a stopping criterion is met.

## What's inside an LLM?

Most modern LLMs are
[decoder-only Transformer models](#are-all-llms-decoder-only-transformer-models).
At a high level, the architecture has three major components:

1. **Input representation**: Token IDs are converted into numerical vectors
   (embeddings). The model also incorporates positional information so it can
   distinguish token order. For example, Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
   encode position within the attention computation.
2. **A stack of Transformer layers**: The embeddings pass through many
   Transformer layers. A typical layer combines a self-attention mechanism,
   which mixes information across tokens, with a feed-forward network, which
   transforms each token independently.
3. **Output head**: The final hidden state is projected into logits, one raw
   score for every token in the vocabulary. These logits are what the model
   [samples from to pick the next token](#how-are-tokens-selected-via-sampling).

Many inference optimizations target either attention computation or the KV
cache that attention uses during generation.

## The attention mechanism

Attention lets the model assign different levels of importance to different
tokens, so it can capture relationships across the sequence.

To do this, each attention layer learns three weight matrices:
$W_Q$ (query weight), $W_K$ (key weight), and $W_V$ (value weight).
These matrices are shared across all token positions and transform the
hidden representation of each token into three vectors:

- **Query (Q)**: A vector that represents a type of information
  the token wants to collect from the other tokens it can attend to.
- **Key (K)**: A vector that represents the type of information the
  token offers. If the key vector is positively aligned with another
  token’s query vector, that other token will "attend to" this token
  (to a degree specified by an attention score, calculated based on
  how well the query and key vectors align).
- **Value (V)**: A vector that represents the actual information the
  token offers to other tokens. If another token attends to this token,
  it will embed a proportion of this value into its token embedding
  (as determined by the attention score).

These three vectors allow the attention mechanism to determine how much each
token attends to every other token, and what it takes away when it does. The
model compares the query vector of the current token with the key vectors of all
tokens it is allowed to attend to using a scaled dot product
($\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}$). The resulting scores indicate how relevant each
token is to the current one. Values play no role in this scoring step.

The scores are then normalized with a softmax function so they become attention
weights that sum to 1. These weights determine how much each value vector
contributes to the current token. Each value vector is multiplied by its
attention weight, and the weighted values are summed together to produce the
attention output for the current token, which updates its representation. In
this way, each token incorporates information from other tokens according to how
much attention it gives them.

In decoder-only LLMs, a causal mask limits each token to attending only to the
current and earlier positions. This is how "bank" ends up meaning something
different in "river bank" and "bank account": the representation of the token is
updated based on the tokens it attends to.

The keys and values computed here are also what the model stores in the KV
cache, which you'll see in the prefill and decode phases below.

For more information, see the
[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper.

## The attention mask

Self-attention can naturally look at every token in the sequence at once, but
that's not always desirable. An attention mask controls which tokens each
token is allowed to attend to.

For standard autoregressive generation, decoder-only LLMs apply a causal mask
(also called a look-ahead mask). The mask is part of the architecture rather
than an optional setting: an autoregressive model predicts the next token from
the tokens before it, so a token must never see tokens that come after it. The
causal mask enforces this by setting attention scores for future positions to
negative infinity before softmax, so their weights become zero and no
information flows from later positions to earlier ones.

The causal mask matters whenever many tokens are processed in parallel, such as
during training and the prefill phase of inference. Without it, earlier tokens
would attend to later ones, producing representations inconsistent with how the
model generates text. During ordinary single-token decode, the model generates
one token at a time and only past tokens exist in the KV cache, so there are no
future positions left to mask.

Attention masks are also used to hide padding tokens, which are filler tokens
added to align sequences of different lengths in a batch and carry no meaning
of their own.

## The two phases of LLM inference

For decoder-only Transformer models like GPT-4, the entire inference process
breaks down into two phases: **prefill and decode**.

### Prefill

When a user sends a query, the LLM's tokenizer converts the prompt into a
sequence of tokens. The prefill phase begins after tokenization:

1. These tokens (or token IDs) are embedded as numerical vectors that the LLM
   can understand.
2. The vectors pass through multiple transformer layers, each containing a
   self-attention mechanism. Here,
   [query (Q), key (K), and value (V) vectors](#the-attention-mechanism) are
   computed for each token. These vectors determine how tokens attend to each
   other (subject to the [causal mask](#the-attention-mask)), capturing
   contextual meaning.
3. As the model processes the prompt, it builds a KV cache to store the key and
   value vectors for every token at every layer. It acts as an internal memory
   for faster lookups during decoding.

During the prefill stage, the entire prompt (namely, the whole sequence of input
tokens) is already available before the LLM starts any actual computation. This
means the LLM can process all tokens simultaneously through highly parallelized
matrix operations, particularly in the attention computations.

As a result, the prefill stage is compute-bound and often saturates GPU
utilization. The actual utilization depends on factors like sequence length,
batch size, and hardware specifications.

A key metric to monitor for prefill is the Time to First Token (TTFT), which
measures the latency from prompt submission to first token generation. More
details will be covered in the
[inference optimization](../inference-optimization/index.md) chapter.

![LLM inference prefill pipeline showing tokenization, prefill, decode, and detokenization stages within Time to First Token (TTFT)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modular/llm-inference-handbook/317b9816ec3080031333ed9ee44dfce919763bf7/static/img/diagrams/llm-inference-prefill.svg)

### Decode

After prefill, the LLM enters the decode stage where it generates new tokens
sequentially, one at a time.

For each new token, the model
[samples from a probability distribution](#how-are-tokens-selected-via-sampling)
generated based on the prompt and all previously generated tokens. This process
is autoregressive, meaning tokens T₀ through Tₙ₋₁ are used to generate token Tₙ,
then T₀ through Tₙ to generate Tₙ₊₁, and so on.

The model can only predict tokens from its own vocabulary during decoding. A
larger vocabulary can represent more text patterns directly, but it also makes
the final prediction layer larger because the model scores every possible next
token.

Use the stepper below to see the autoregressive loop in slow motion. Each click
predicts one new token from the full sequence built so far.

> The [token-by-token decode visualizer](https://handbook.modular.com/llm-inference-basics/how-does-llm-inference-work/) is available on the rendered handbook.

Each newly generated token is appended to the growing sequence. This
autoregressive loop continues until:

- A maximum token limit is reached,
- A stop word is generated,
- Or a special end-of-sequence token (e.g., `<end>`) appears.

Finally, the sequence of generated tokens is decoded back into human-readable
text.

Compared with prefill, decode is more memory-bound because it requires the model
weights and the growing KV cache to be frequently read from memory. KV caching
stores these key and value matrices in memory so that, during subsequent token
generation, the LLM only needs to compute the keys and values for the new tokens
rather than recomputing everything from scratch.

This KV caching mechanism significantly speeds up inference by avoiding
redundant computation. However, it comes at the cost of increased memory
consumption, since the cache grows with the length of the generated sequence. KV
cache memory can become a serving bottleneck even when the model weights already
fit on the GPU. Some inference systems reduce this pressure by compressing or
quantizing the KV cache, while others move inactive cache blocks to cheaper
memory through
[KV cache offloading](../inference-optimization/kv-cache-offloading.md).

A key metric to monitor for decode is Inter-Token Latency (ITL), the time
between the generation of consecutive tokens in a sequence.

### Collocating prefill and decode

Traditional LLM serving systems typically run both the prefill and decode phases
on the same hardware. However, this setup introduces several challenges.

One major issue is the interference between the prefill and decode phases, as
they cannot run fully in parallel. In production, multiple requests can arrive
at once, each with its own prefill and decode stages that overlap across
different requests. However, only one phase can run at a time. When the GPU is
occupied with compute-heavy prefill tasks, decode tasks must wait, increasing
token latency, and vice versa. This makes it difficult to schedule resources for
both phases.

The open-source community is actively working on different strategies to
separate prefill and decode. For more information, see
[prefill-decode disaggregation](../inference-optimization/prefill-decode-disaggregation.md).

## What is a context window and how does it work in LLM inference?

The context window is the number of tokens an LLM can process in a single
inference pass. It includes the entire conversation history that must be resent
each turn to maintain coherence.

> The [context-window simulator](https://handbook.modular.com/llm-inference-basics/how-does-llm-inference-work/) is available on the rendered handbook.

Technically, LLMs don’t have real memory. To keep context, every new request
must resend all previous messages so the model can “see” the full conversation
again (it happens under the hood and users don’t see it). In other words,
continuity is maintained by reconstructing the context through the input prompt
each time.

![How the conversation context grows across turns, increasing tokens processed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modular/llm-inference-handbook/317b9816ec3080031333ed9ee44dfce919763bf7/static/img/diagrams/context-window.svg)

This running text history is called the context window, which has a maximum
length (e.g., 8K, 32K, or 128K tokens).

As mentioned above, LLMs use the KV cache from previous tokens to avoid fully
reprocessing everything in the decode phase, which helps with latency. When
reusing the KV cache across multiple requests, it is more accurate to call this
technique [prefix caching](../inference-optimization/prefix-caching.md).

## Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)

The autoregressive pattern of LLMs has a natural bottleneck: slow and
computationally expensive.

Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) flip that logic. They output the entire response in
parallel through a denoising process inspired by image generation models like
Stable Diffusion.

Here’s the basic idea:

1. The model starts with a cloud of noise, representing a rough sketch of
   possible outputs.
2. Through several denoising steps, it gradually refines that noise into
   coherent text.
3. The final answer emerges all at once, like an image coming into focus.

This parallel process removes the token-by-token bottleneck. It also allows
dLLMs to iterate and self-correct during generation, which makes them
particularly strong at tasks like editing, mathematical reasoning, and code
completion.

Early examples of dLLMs include:

- [Mercury](https://x.com/_inception_ai/status/1894847919624462794) by Inception
  AI: reportedly delivers inference up to 10× faster and more efficient than
  traditional LLMs.
- [Gemini Diffusion](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/) by Google
  DeepMind: an early exploration of applying diffusion to text generation. It is
  available as an experimental demo to help develop and refine future models.

For now, autoregressive LLMs remain the mainstream architecture. However, dLLMs
represent one of the most promising directions to power the next generation of
inference systems. If you’re working with autoregressive LLMs today, it’s worth
keeping an eye on dLLMs.

## FAQs

### Are all LLMs decoder-only Transformer models?

No. LLMs can be built using different Transformer architectures, including
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models.

However, when people talk about LLMs today, they are usually referring to
decoder-only Transformer models. They dominate modern generative AI applications
such as chatbots and coding assistants. Most inference techniques discussed
today, including KV caching, continuous batching, speculative decoding, and
prefill-decode disaggregation, are designed around this architecture.

### What is KV cache?

The KV cache is the memory an LLM uses to store the key (K) and value (V)
vectors it has already computed, so it doesn't have to compute them again.

Attention works by having each token attend to every token before it. Without a
cache, generating token 1,000 would mean recomputing the keys and values for the
999 tokens that came first, then repeating that work for token 1,001. Because
those vectors depend only on the tokens themselves and not on what comes after,
they never change once computed. Caching them turns each decode step into
computing K and V for a single new token and reading the rest back from memory.
This is how the KV cache mecahnism helps speed up inference.

As the sequence length grows during inference, the KV cache becomes the dominant
factor in memory usage. For Llama 3 8B in FP16, for example, a single 8K-token
sequence holds about 1 GB of KV cache (learn more about
[the calculation](../inference-optimization/kv-cache-offloading.md#how-to-calculate-the-kv-cache-size)).
The weights take roughly 16 GB. On an 80 GB GPU, this leaves at most around 64
GB for the KV cache and other runtime data, giving a theoretical upper bound of
roughly 60 such sequences. This is why the KV cache, not the model weights, is
usually what limits how many users a server can handle.

The KV cache is the thing several optimization techniques in this handbook are
built around:

- [PagedAttention](../inference-optimization/pagedattention.md) stores the cache in
  fixed-size blocks to avoid fragmentation and over-reservation
- [Prefix caching](../inference-optimization/prefix-caching.md) reuses the cache for
  a shared prompt prefix across requests
- [KV cache offloading](../inference-optimization/kv-cache-offloading.md) moves
  inactive blocks to CPU memory or disk, and includes a calculator for the
  example above
- [Prefill-decode disaggregation](../inference-optimization/prefill-decode-disaggregation.md)
  splits the two phases across workers and transfers the cache between them

### How are tokens selected via sampling?

At each decode step, the model does not directly output a word. Instead, it
produces a probability distribution over all possible tokens.

Sampling is the process of selecting the next token from this distribution.

Before sampling, temperature is applied to the logits (the raw pre-softmax
scores). It rescales them, which changes the shape of the distribution before
probabilities are computed.

- **Lower temperature**: the distribution becomes more peaked (a few tokens
  dominate)
- **Higher temperature**: the distribution becomes flatter (probability spreads
  across more tokens)

After applying temperature and converting logits into probabilities, a sampling
strategy determines which token gets picked. Common ones include greedy
decoding, top-k, and top-p.

Learn more about
[LLM inference parameters](../model-interaction/inference-parameters.md).

### What happens step by step during LLM inference?

At a high level, LLM inference follows a simple loop:

1. The input text is converted into tokens
2. Tokens are processed in the prefill phase to build context and KV cache
3. The model enters the decode phase. At each step:
    - The model produces a probability distribution
    - A sampling strategy selects the next token
4. The process repeats until a stopping condition is met
5. Tokens are converted back into readable text

Even though the output feels instant, this process runs one token at a time
during decoding.

### Why is LLM inference slow?

LLM inference can be slow for two main reasons:

- **Sequential decoding**: tokens are generated one by one, which limits
  parallelism
- **Memory bottlenecks**: during decoding, the model repeatedly reads from KV
  cache in GPU memory

Other factors also affect latency:

- Model size (more parameters mean more computation)
- Input length (longer prompts increase prefill time)
- Hardware (GPU type and memory bandwidth)

This is why [inference optimization](../inference-optimization/index.md) is a major focus
in production systems.
