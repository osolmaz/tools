# Data, tensor, pipeline, expert and hybrid parallelisms

Parallelism strategies distribute inference work across multiple devices to
improve throughput, fit larger models, and use hardware more efficiently. New
parallelization strategies continue to emerge as models grow larger and more
complex.

## Data parallelism

Data parallelism is a common technique to accelerate computation. In this
approach, the model's weights are replicated across multiple GPU devices, and
the global batch of input data is divided into smaller microbatches. Each device
only processes the microbatch assigned to it and this process happens in
parallel for all devices. This delivers faster execution by allowing larger
batches to be processed simultaneously.

## Tensor parallelism

Tensor parallelism slices individual layers of the model into smaller blocks.
These blocks are computed independently and in parallel across different
devices. For example, during matrix multiplication, different slices of the
matrix can be processed simultaneously on different GPUs.

This approach delivers faster computation and allows serving LLMs that do not
fit into the memory of a single device. However, because it involves extra
communication between devices, you need to balance the performance gain against
this overhead.

## Pipeline parallelism

[Pipeline parallelism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965) divides the model’s
layers into sequential chunks, each assigned to a separate device. Data flows
through these chunks like an assembly line, with the output of one device
becoming the input for the next. For instance, in a four-way pipeline, each
device processes a quarter of the model’s layers.

However, because each device depends on the output of the previous one, some
devices may be idle at times, which means resource underutilization. To reduce
these idle periods, the input batch can be split into smaller microbatches. Each
microbatch flows through the pipeline one by one, and gradients are accumulated
at the end. This microbatching improves GPU utilization, though it does not
completely eliminate idle time.

Note that pipeline parallelism can increase the total latency for each request
because of communication between different pipeline stages.

## Expert parallelism

Expert parallelism is a specialized parallelism strategy used in Mixture of
Experts (MoE) models. In these models, only a subset of the model’s experts is
activated for each token. Instead of duplicating all experts across every device
(e.g., GPU), expert parallelism splits the experts themselves across different
devices.

![Expert parallelism: a router dispatches requests to experts across GPUs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modular/llm-inference-handbook/317b9816ec3080031333ed9ee44dfce919763bf7/static/img/diagrams/ep-inference.svg)

Each GPU holds the full weights of only some experts, not all. This means that
each GPU processes only the tokens assigned to the experts stored on that GPU.
In contrast, if you apply tensor parallelism for MoE models, it simply slices
the weight matrices of all experts and distributes these slices across all
devices.

By using expert parallelism, GPUs can be utilized more efficiently. This reduces
memory and compute overhead compared to replicating the entire model on every
device.

## Hybrid parallelism

For certain models, relying on a single parallelism strategy is often not
enough. Hybrid parallelism combines two or more parallelism techniques to
achieve better scalability, efficiency, and hardware utilization.

A typical hybrid setup might look like this (combining data parallelism and
tensor parallelism):

![Tensor parallelism within two data-parallel model replicas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modular/llm-inference-handbook/317b9816ec3080031333ed9ee44dfce919763bf7/static/img/diagrams/dptp.svg)

If you have 8 GPUs, you could apply tensor parallelism across the first four
GPUs (TP=4), then replicate that setup to the remaining ones using data
parallelism (DP=2).

Note that this is only one of the possible combinations, each with advantages
and disadvantages. In the above example, tensor parallelism introduces
communication overhead between GPUs, especially during inference. Therefore,
using a high TP degree doesn't always translate to better performance.

An alternative configuration is to reduce tensor parallelism and increase data
parallelism. For example, you can set TP=2 and DP=4:

![Tensor parallelism (2) combined with data parallelism (4) across eight GPUs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modular/llm-inference-handbook/317b9816ec3080031333ed9ee44dfce919763bf7/static/img/diagrams/dp4tp2.svg)

This reduces cross-GPU communication, which may help lower latency during
inference. However, there’s a catch: model weights consume a large portion of
GPU memory, especially for large models. Lowering tensor parallelism means fewer
GPUs share the model, leaving less room for KV cache. This can degrade inference
optimizations like prefix caching.

These trade-offs aren’t unique to tensor and data parallelism. When designing a
hybrid parallelism plan, it’s essential to benchmark different configurations
based on your specific model size, hardware setup, and inference requirements.
There’s no one-size-fits-all setup. The optimal strategy is often found through
tuning and experimentation.
