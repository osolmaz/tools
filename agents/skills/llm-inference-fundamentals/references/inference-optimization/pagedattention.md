# PagedAttention

[PagedAttention](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html) is a memory-efficient approach to implementing the attention mechanism in LLMs.

## Why contiguous KV cache allocation wastes memory

When an LLM is generating a response, it needs to [remember past information (i.e. the KV cache) for every token it generates](../llm-inference-basics/how-does-llm-inference-work#the-two-phases-of-llm-inference). Normally, the KV cache takes up a big chunk of memory because it’s stored as one giant continuous block. This can lead to memory fragmentation or wasted space because you need to reserve a big block even if you don’t fill it fully.

Specifically, early serving engines often allocated KV cache as a contiguous tensor sized for the worst case. [A simplified shape](./kv-cache-offloading#how-to-calculate-the-kv-cache-size) is:

```bash
2 × num_layers × num_heads × head_dim × max_seq_len
```

That allocation happens per active request, before accounting for batch size and the number of bytes per element. It is simple, but it assumes every request will use the maximum sequence length. Real traffic is variable: one request may generate a short answer, another may keep a long conversation alive, and another may stop early. If each request reserves memory for `max_seq_len`, much of the reserved GPU memory can sit unused.

The result is lower effective batch size, more memory fragmentation, and fewer concurrent requests. 

## How does PagedAttention work?

PagedAttention breaks this big chunk into smaller blocks, kind of like pages in a book. In other words, the KV cache is stored in non-contiguous blocks. It then uses a lookup table to keep track of these blocks. The LLM only loads the blocks it needs, instead of loading everything at once.

This saves memory and makes the whole process more efficient. It even allows the same blocks to be shared across different outputs if needed.

The original PagedAttention paper reports that, without PagedAttention, only 20.4%-38.2% of allocated KV cache memory is used to store actual token states, with the remainder wasted due to fragmentation. By contrast, PagedAttention reduces KV cache memory waste to nearly zero.

This is why PagedAttention matters beyond a single attention kernel. It gives the serving engine a better memory allocator for KV cache, which then makes techniques like [continuous batching](./static-dynamic-continuous-batching), [prefix caching](./prefix-caching), and [KV cache offloading](./kv-cache-offloading) easier to combine.

PagedAttention was first implemented by vLLM. Since then, other projects like Hugging Face TGI and TensorRT-LLM have also adopted and implemented PagedAttention.
