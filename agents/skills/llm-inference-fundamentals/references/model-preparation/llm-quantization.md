# LLM quantization

Quantization is a technique used to reduce the memory and compute requirements of models by converting their weights and activations from high-precision formats (like FP32) to lower-precision formats such as INT8, INT4, or even INT2.

Fewer bits mean lower memory consumption for the model. For example:

- A 7B model in FP32 format is highly precise, but it requires 28 GB of memory just for the weights.
- The same model in FP16 cuts memory use in half.
- Lower-precision formats like INT8 or INT4 compress the model even further, dramatically reducing the size.

These figures only account for model weights. Runtime elements, such as attention caches, activations, and framework overhead, require additional memory.

## Why use quantization

Quantization can help LLM inference in three main ways:

- **Smaller model footprint**. The number of bits per parameter directly affects how much memory the model weights require. For example, a 7B model needs about 14 GB for FP16 weights but about 7 GB for INT8 weights. This can make the difference between fitting the model on one GPU or distributing it across multiple GPUs or nodes.
- **Less data movement**. LLM decoding is often limited by GPU memory bandwidth because the runtime repeatedly reads model weights while generating tokens. Lower-precision weights mean fewer bytes to be moved from [GPU memory to the compute units](../kernel-optimization/gpu-architecture-fundamentals), which can reduce per-token latency.
- **Faster computation**. GPUs and other accelerators can process supported low-precision formats at higher throughput than FP32 or FP16. [On the H100 SXM](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/), for example, the BF16/FP16 tensor cores hit 1,979 TFLOPS, while FP8 and INT8 double that to 3,958 TFLOPS/TOPS, a clean 2x from halving the bit width. The actual speedup depends on whether the hardware and inference runtime provide optimized kernels for the chosen format.

A smaller weight footprint also leaves more GPU memory available for the [KV cache](../llm-inference-basics/how-does-llm-inference-work#the-two-phases-of-llm-inference), larger batches, and more concurrent requests. Weight quantization does not reduce the KV cache size per token by itself. It requires quantizing the KV cache separately.

This tradeoff between precision and size comes with **some drop in accuracy**. For many applications, the above benefits matter only if the generated output remains reliable enough for production use. For example, a faster model that produces noticeably worse responses is rarely a worthwhile trade-off.

The good news is that modern quantization methods have made this trade-off much less severe. Techniques such as GPTQ W4A16, AWQ, and FP8 quantization for both weights and activations often [preserve nearly the same accuracy](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/10/17/we-ran-over-half-million-evaluations-quantized-llms) as the original model, with meaningful improvements in inference efficiency. As a result, many production deployments can adopt quantization with little or no noticeable impact on model quality.

## Quantization formats

Different quantization formats offer a balance between size savings and accuracy. Here's a quick guide:

| Format | Size vs FP32 | Accuracy Drop | Use Case | Memory | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FP32** | 100% | None | Training | High | Full precision, but slow |
| **FP16** | 50% | Minimal | Training & Inference | Medium | Standard for most LLMs |
| **FP8** | 25% | Low | Training & Inference | Low | Still emerging |
| **INT8** | 25% | Low | Inference | Low | Good all-around trade-off |
| **INT4** | 12.5% | Moderate | Inference | Very Low | Needs methods like GPTQ/AWQ |
| **INT2** | 6.25% | High | Rare/Experimental | Tiny | Accuracy often poor |

Use the visualizer below to see how these tradeoffs play out for your model size. Note that for MoE models, this calculator uses total stored parameters, not activated parameters per token.

This calculator estimates **weight memory only**. Use the [GPU memory calculator](../getting-started/calculating-gpu-memory-for-llms) to estimate your overall requirements.

## What to quantize

Generally, you want to focus on what consumes the most memory without hurting performance too much.

- Model weights are the most commonly quantized component. They’re stable and contribute heavily to memory usage.
- Activations can also be quantized, but this is trickier and may lead to more accuracy loss.
- The KV cache can be quantized at runtime to reduce memory pressure in long-context serving. This is different from weight quantization because the cache is generated during inference and is read repeatedly during decoding. The main challenge is preserving attention quality: the model still needs accurate key/query similarity scores after the key and value vectors are stored in fewer bits.

## Quantization vs. pruning

Quantization is not the only way to reduce model size. Another related technique is model pruning.

Pruning removes parameters that contribute little to the output of a model. They can be individual weights, neurons, attention heads, or even entire layers. By eliminating redundant components, pruning produces a smaller and sparser model, which can reduce compute requirements and accelerate inference speed.

Pruning and quantization are often used together in a deployment pipeline:

1. Train the model
2. Prune less important weights
3. Fine-tune the model
4. Quantize the weights
5. Deploy for inference

In simple terms:

- Quantization reduces the number of bits used to represent each weight.
- Pruning reduces the number of weights in the model.

Both techniques aim to reduce memory usage and computational cost during inference. However, quantization is generally easier to apply in production systems because modern hardware provides strong support for low-precision arithmetic.

## When to use quantization

Quantization is a good choice if:

- You're deploying to hardware with limited GPU memory (e.g., 24GB or less).
- You want lower inference latency.
- You need to reduce serving costs.
- You want to support higher concurrency. Quantization reduces KV cache size per token, allowing more tokens (and therefore more parallel requests) to fit within the same GPU memory.
- You can tolerate small accuracy trade-offs.

Quantization may not be a good choice if:

- You need the highest possible accuracy (e.g., for sensitive or safety-critical tasks).
- Your model is already small (quantization offers limited benefit here).
- Your deployment hardware doesn't support quantized formats.

The quantized variants of many popular foundation models are already available on Hugging Face, so you don't need to quantize the models yourself. You can often find them in the model tree section.

## Quantization methods

Several advanced quantization techniques have been developed to make LLMs more efficient without significant loss in performance.

Below are some widely adopted quantization approaches:

### AWQ

[Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00978) is designed specifically for running LLMs on edge or resource-constrained devices. The core insight is that not all weights contribute equally to performance. Its developers believe only ~1% of weights are "salient" and need extra care during quantization. Therefore, this approach selectively protects the most impactful weights based on activation distributions, not just the weights themselves.

At a high level, AWQ applies an equivalent transformation that scales important weight channels based on offline-collected activation statistics.

It is ideal for low-bit quantization on models deployed in edge settings or latency-sensitive environments.

### SmoothQuant

[SmoothQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10438) is a general-purpose, training-free method for post-training quantization (PTQ) that enables efficient 8-bit quantization of both weights and activations (W8A8).

While quantizing weights is relatively straightforward, activations are much harder due to outliers that can significantly degrade accuracy. SmoothQuant solves this by "smoothing" the activation outliers. It mathematically shifts quantization difficulty from activations to weights through an equivalent transformation. As a result, it achieves up to 2× memory reduction and up to 1.56× speedup for LLMs.

SmoothQuant is a great choice when you want:

- Full INT8 quantization (weights and activations)
- High hardware efficiency without retraining
- Minimal accuracy drop
- Plug-and-play compatibility with most transformer models

It’s a turnkey solution that balances accuracy, performance, and ease of use. It’s ideal for production scenarios that demand efficiency at scale.

### GPTQ

[GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) is a fast, post-training quantization method that compresses large transformer models to 3–4 bits per weight with minimal accuracy loss. It’s specifically designed for scaling to models with hundreds of billions of parameters and does so without retraining.

Highlights:

- Efficient at scale: Can quantize models like OPT-175B or BLOOM-176B in ~4 GPU hours.
- Minimal accuracy loss: Maintains low perplexity, even with aggressive compression.
- Extreme quantization: Supports 2-bit and ternary quantization, still with usable performance.
- Runs massive models on single GPUs: Enables inference of 175B models on a single A100 or two A6000s.
- Performance gains: Custom GPU kernels yield ~3.25× speedup over FP16.

GPTQ is widely used in open-source model serving pipelines, especially with AutoGPTQ. It is a go-to choice for high-speed, low-memory inference of large models.

Many [modern inference frameworks](../getting-started/choosing-the-right-inference-framework) not only serve quantized models efficiently but also provide built-in APIs or tooling to quantize models. In other cases, models are quantized offline using specialized tools and then loaded directly by the serving framework. As a result, most users no longer need to implement quantization algorithms themselves.

You can often start with an already quantized model from [Hugging Face](../getting-started/choosing-the-right-model/#hugging-face). It hosts many pre-quantized variants, such as 8-bit and 4-bit models, that are ready for inference and optimized for lower memory usage and faster deployment. At the same time, it also provides full-precision base models if you want to apply your own quantization strategy.
