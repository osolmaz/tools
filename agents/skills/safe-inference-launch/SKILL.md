description: Use before starting, smoke-testing, benchmarking, or compiling local LLM inference runtimes such as vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, TensorRT-LLM, Ollama, LM Studio CLI, FlashInfer, or modelopt-backed servers. Prevents local OOM incidents by requiring target verification, earlyoom/process watchdogs, memory preflight, staged smoke tests, and monitored launches instead of direct server commands.

# Safe inference launch

Use this skill before any local inference process can allocate large CPU RAM,
GPU memory, swap, or compile caches.

This skill is mandatory for local starts of:

- `vllm serve`, `python -m vllm`, `api_server`, `gpu_worker`
- `llama-server`, `llama-cli`, `llama-bench`
- SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, TGI, MAX, Ollama, LM Studio CLI
- FlashInfer, modelopt, Triton, CUDA, or large safetensors/GGUF compile/load paths

Do not use this skill for a remote API request unless the command would also
start local containers or local model serving.

## First decision

Before launching anything local, verify the intended target:

1. If the user intended a remote endpoint, API, or cloud provider, test that
   endpoint first. Do not start a local model as a fallback unless the user
   explicitly asks for local fallback.
2. If the target is local, continue with the guard workflow below.

Remote endpoint checks should be small and non-streaming:

```bash
curl -sS -i "$OPENAI_BASE_URL/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" | sed -n '1,40p'
```

If auth or endpoint access fails, report that. Do not compensate by launching a
local runtime.

## Required local guard workflow

Never start local inference with a raw command. Use the bundled watchdog:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/safe-inference-launch/scripts/guarded-launch.sh \
  --label qwen-vllm \
  --min-mem-gb 24 \
  --min-swap-gb 4 \
  --poll-sec 1 \
  -- \
  vllm serve ...
```

The guard:

- refuses to run unless `earlyoom` is active, unless explicitly overridden
- starts the command in its own process group
- polls `MemAvailable` and `SwapFree`
- sends `TERM`, then `KILL`, to the whole process group if pressure crosses the
  configured floor
- exits `137` when it killed the launch for memory pressure

## Automatic shims

Prefer automatic shims over relying on a human or agent to remember the guard.

Install PATH-level shims:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/safe-inference-launch/scripts/install-shims.sh
```

That creates guarded command names such as `~/.local/bin/vllm` and
`~/.local/bin/llama-server`. They resolve the real binary later in `PATH` and
run it through `guarded-launch.sh`.

For scripts that call an absolute runtime path, wrap the binary in place:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/safe-inference-launch/scripts/install-shims.sh \
  --wrap ~/runtimes/vllm/current/.venv/bin/vllm
```

The in-place wrapper moves the original executable to `vllm.real` and replaces
`vllm` with a guarded shim. This protects existing scripts that already point at
the absolute runtime binary.

Generated shims use these default guard floors:

- `SAFE_INFERENCE_MIN_MEM_GB=24`
- `SAFE_INFERENCE_MIN_SWAP_GB=4`

Override those environment variables only for a specific command or benchmark.

Uninstall managed shims with:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/safe-inference-launch/scripts/install-shims.sh --uninstall
~/.codex/skills/safe-inference-launch/scripts/install-shims.sh \
  --uninstall --wrap ~/runtimes/vllm/current/.venv/bin/vllm
```

Use `--allow-no-earlyoom` only for tiny CPU-only tests or when the user
explicitly accepts the risk. Do not use it for vLLM, llama.cpp servers, CUDA,
FlashInfer, TensorRT-LLM, or large model loads.

## Preflight

Run these before the guarded launch:

```bash
free -h
df -h "$HOME"
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,rss,etime,cmd --sort=-rss | head -25
nvidia-smi
pgrep -a earlyoom
```

Then state the launch budget:

- model and quantization
- expected weight/cache footprint if known
- context length
- max concurrent sequences or users
- guard thresholds
- expected disk/cache growth

If disk is tight, do not clear caches or delete Docker state unless the user
explicitly approves or already asked for cleanup. Report what would be removed.

## Safe defaults

For large GPU servers on an interactive workstation:

- `--min-mem-gb 24`
- `--min-swap-gb 4`
- `--poll-sec 1`
- conservative first start: `max_num_seqs <= 4`, context `<= 16k`
- full benchmark only after a successful smoke test

For known-stable local benchmark servers:

- `--min-mem-gb 16`
- `--min-swap-gb 2`
- keep the same process guard for the full benchmark

For small CPU-only llama.cpp tests:

- `--min-mem-gb 8`
- `--min-swap-gb 1`

Raise the floors when the desktop/session must stay responsive or when the
machine has known background jobs.

## Staged launch

Use stages. Do not jump straight to a full benchmark.

1. Start the server with the guard.
2. Wait for readiness with a small `/v1/models` or health check.
3. Run one tiny completion.
4. Run one representative long-context smoke if the benchmark needs it.
5. Only then start Harbor, localperf, or other benchmark traffic.

During benchmark traffic, monitor:

```bash
free -h
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,rss,etime,cmd --sort=-rss | head -25
nvidia-smi
```

If the guard kills the process, treat the run as invalid infrastructure data,
not a model score.

## Stop conditions

Stop or refuse the run when:

- `earlyoom` is absent or inactive for a large local inference launch
- `MemAvailable` is already below the chosen floor
- swap is nearly full before launch
- disk has too little space for model/cache growth
- stale local inference processes are already consuming memory
- the user asked for a remote endpoint and local launch would be a fallback

Do not keep retrying after a memory-pressure kill without reducing local load
or moving back to the intended remote target.
