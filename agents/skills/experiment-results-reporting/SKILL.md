# Experiment Results Reporting

## Workflow

1. Define the comparison window.

- Set a clear `before` baseline (usually shipped model) and `after` candidate.
- If multiple candidates exist, use the one selected for shipping.
- Refuse "improved" claims without both baseline and candidate numbers.

2. Extract the required metrics.

- Always capture:
  - Dataset size (`total samples` or split sizes).
  - Scam precision, scam recall, scam false-positive rate.
  - Topic recall and false-positive rate (`topic_crypto` when present).
  - One overall metric (`exact`, `micro_f1`, or `accuracy`).
  - Model size (`KB` or `MB`).
- Prefer JSON artifacts under `docs/reports/experiments/**`.
- Use text eval files only when JSON is missing.

3. Compute and state deltas.

- For each headline metric, show `before -> after (delta)`.
- Treat direction correctly:
  - Higher is better: precision, recall, F1, accuracy.
  - Lower is better: false-positive rate.
- Mention every meaningful regression, even when net result is positive.

4. Translate to plain language.

- Map terms consistently:
  - `false positive rate (FPR)` -> `false alarm rate`.
  - `precision` -> `when we flag something, how often we are right`.
  - `recall` -> `how many real cases we catch`.
- Avoid unexplained jargon in public copy (`holdout`, `calib`, `macro`).
- If technical terms must appear, add a one-line explanation.

5. Produce output for channel.

- Return these by default unless user asks otherwise:
  - `TLDR` one-liner.
  - `Tweet` (<=280 chars, numbers first, plain wording).
  - `Release note` bullets (3-6 bullets, includes tradeoffs).
- Keep percentages to one decimal place unless precision is critical.

## Output Rules

- Always include absolute context with rates when available (example: `18 false alarms out of 1,000 posts`).
- Never hide tradeoffs. If recall drops while false alarms improve, state both.
- Do not report only relative percentages without raw before/after values.
- When sources conflict, call out the mismatch and ask which artifact is canonical.

## Quick Commands

Use these as starting points and adjust the date/path:

```bash
# Compare shipped baseline vs tuned single-stage summary
jq '.baseline_shipped_holdout, .single_stage_class_specific_best_holdout' \
  docs/reports/experiments/2026-02-11/SUMMARY_AGGREGATED.json

# Pull winner metrics from bakeoff summary
jq '.overall_winner_by_gate' \
  docs/reports/experiments/2026-02-11-postsplit-bakeoff/2026-02-11-bakeoff_summary.json

# Parse class metrics from text eval when JSON is unavailable
rg -n "Per-class metrics|exact match accuracy|micro precision|scam|topic_crypto|clean" \
  docs/reports/experiments/**/*.txt
```

## Templates

Use `references/public-copy-templates.md` to generate:

- Plain-language TLDR
- Public tweet
- Release-note bullet list
